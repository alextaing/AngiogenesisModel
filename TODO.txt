IDEAS FOR FUTURE:
circular wound: how know which direction to move towards center of wound? macrophages?
- make probability that move vertically/horizontally as sides of a right triangle
e.g. if 25% move up, 25% move right, and 50% random, then it will overall move 45 deg. up/right with some random
- collecting vessel lengths: by instead of saying top/bottom vessel, keep origin point as passed variable then use distance formula for each tip cell

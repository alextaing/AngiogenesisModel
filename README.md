# HAL2020-ATaing

Welcome to my GitHub!  This repository is for the models of endothelial cell growth with Heparin-MAP particles I've made at my time here at Griffin Lab.  All code on this repo uses the HAL library, and can be installed below:

http://halloworld.org/start_here.html

Getting the model working:

1) Install IntelliJ
2) Install the HAL library
2) Clone the repository (i.e. download the zip file by clicking the green "Code" button) and extract the files
3) From the HAL library, copy the file HAL and HalColorSchemes.jar and place them within the HAL2020-ATaing file along with the other files
4) Open IntelliJ, ctrl + shift + a to bring up the search menu and find "Import Project from Existing Sources" clicking accept for default options. NOTE: IntelliJ should recognize the libraries "lib" and "HalColorSchemes" automatically.  If not, then they will have to be manually added as libraries afterwards.  (i.e. at the end of the tutorial, open the Project, find File, Project Structure, Libraries, then click the plus sign and find and add the file "lib" and the file "HalColorSchemes.jar" as libraries separately)
5) If there are 2 .iml files in the directory HAL2020-ATaing, delete the HAL2020-ATaing-main.iml, and rename the file HAL2020-ATaing.iml the same name as the deleted file (HAL2020-ATaing-main.iml), effectively replacing it.
6) If there are other errors from unprovided libraries, these will have to be dealt with on a case by case basis.

Enjoy!
